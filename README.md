  ## The Title of the Application
E-Commerce Backend

## Description
This project was created to provide a back end database for an e-commerce "website". When you run the schema in the terminal using sql you will be able to create a new database and when you run npm run seed it will seed all of the data. Using insomnia you are able to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE different items as well as update items in the database.

 ## Installation Instructions
 You will need to run npm i to install the node modules as well as running a database program such as mysql to view the tables in a different manner. Using insomnia will allow you to update the information that is stored in the database.
